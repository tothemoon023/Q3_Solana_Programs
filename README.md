Q3 Solana Programs

[Q3_Solana_Builders_Qualifier ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Q3_2025_Builders_Qualifier) : Turbin3 Part 1 and Part 2 qualifier programs, Q3-2025 (typescript and rust).A Solana blockchain project demonstrating airdrop functionality and wallet management with implementations in both Rust and TypeScript. This project showcases interaction with the Solana devnet, including wallet creation, airdrop claiming, token transfers, and program enrollment.

[Q3_Solana_Builders_Solana-starter ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Q3_Solana-Starter) : A comprehensive development kit featuring Rust smart contracts and TypeScript client implementations for building on Solana. Includes NFT operations, SPL token management, vault systems, and complete wallet integration. Perfect for developers learning Solana development with practical examples in both Rust and TypeScript. 

[Q3_Solana_Builders_Anchor-Vault ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Q3_Anchor-Vault) :The vault program contains a simple Solana smart contract built with Anchor that allows users to create their own secure, on-chain SOL vaults. With this program, users can easily deposit, withdraw, and manage their funds, ensuring full control and safety of their assets on the Solana blockchain.

[Q3_Solana_Builders_Solana-Escrow ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Q3_Solana_Escrow/tree/main) :A secure escrow smart contract for the Solana blockchain, built with the Anchor framework.
This project enables two parties to safely exchange SPL tokens using an on-chain escrow account. The program ensures that funds are only released when both parties fulfill their obligations, with all assets held in program-controlled PDAs for maximum security. Features include permissioned refunds (only the escrow creator can cancel), compatibility with SPL Token 2022, and clear, auditable logic for easy review and extension. Includes comprehensive tests and a modular codebase for easy customization.

[Q3_Solana_Builders_Solana-AMM ](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Q3_Solana_AMM):The amm program contains a complete Solana-based Automated Market Maker (AMM) project built with the Anchor framework. It includes everything needed to deploy, test, and interact with a decentralized liquidity pool and swap protocol, inspired by Uniswap. With this project, users can swap between two tokens using a constant product formula, provide liquidity to earn trading fees, and mint or burn LP tokens representing their share of the pool. The AMM features slippage protection, admin-controlled pool locking, and fully on-chain logic. The folder structure includes the Rust smart contract source code, integration tests, deployment scripts, optional frontend/client code, and all necessary configuration files, making it an ideal starting point for building decentralized exchanges or liquidity pools on Solana.

[Q3_Solana_Builders_Solana-NFT-Staking](https://github.com/tothemoon023/Q3_Solana_NFT-Staking):A comprehensive Solana smart contract that enables NFT holders to stake their digital assets and earn reward tokens over time. Built with the Anchor framework and integrated with SPL Token and Metaplex protocols, it features secure NFT freezing mechanisms, configurable reward tokenomics, and production-ready security validations. The project includes over 500 lines of educational comments, visual flow diagrams, real-world implementation examples, and step-by-step guides that make it ideal for both learning Solana development and deploying commercial NFT staking systems.
